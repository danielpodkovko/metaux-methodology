collection_environment:
  display_name: "Data Collection Environment"
  competency: "Data Quality Assessment Recognition"
  family: "data_quality"
  
  purpose: "Assesses whether physical and social environment enables or corrupts quality data collection"
  
  concept_explanation: "The collection environment encompasses all external factors during data gathering - physical space, technical setup, social dynamics, and interruptions. Even the best methodology can be undermined by a hostile environment, while a well-controlled environment enables authentic responses."
  
  values:
    hostile:
      level: 1
      label: "Actively hostile"
      quality_signal: "VERY_LOW"
      description: "Environment actively corrupts data through hostility or system failures"
      observable_signals:
        - "Participants angry about situation itself"
        - "Technical systems failing during collection"
        - "Researchers abandoning protocol due to chaos"
      scenario_manifestation: "Session degenerates into complaints about problems rather than feedback"
      real_example:
        context: "Testing during system outage"
        observation: "Users couldn't complete tasks due to crashes, sessions became venting about reliability"
        
    disruptive:
      level: 2
      label: "Significantly disruptive"
      quality_signal: "LOW"
      description: "Environment introduces noise and interruptions compromising quality"
      observable_signals:
        - "Multiple interruptions breaking flow"
        - "Background noise obscuring responses"
        - "Participants visibly distracted"
      scenario_manifestation: "Researchers struggle to hear responses, participants keep losing focus"
      real_example:
        context: "Coffee shop interviews"
        observation: "Espresso machine noise made recordings partially inaudible, participants kept checking phones"
        
    suboptimal:
      level: 3
      label: "Less than ideal"
      quality_signal: "MEDIUM"
      description: "Minor environmental issues requiring workarounds"
      observable_signals:
        - "Occasional interruptions managed well"
        - "Some constraints acknowledged in notes"
        - "Researchers successfully adapt"
      scenario_manifestation: "Team works around minor issues, maintains data quality despite constraints"
      real_example:
        context: "Conference room with some distractions"
        observation: "Closed doors when needed, repeated questions after interruptions, all critical data captured"
        
    controlled:
      level: 4
      label: "Well-controlled"
      quality_signal: "HIGH"
      description: "Environment supports quality data collection"
      observable_signals:
        - "Quiet, private space"
        - "Participants relaxed and focused"
        - "Technical setup working smoothly"
      scenario_manifestation: "Participants can think deeply and respond thoughtfully"
      real_example:
        context: "Dedicated research room"
        observation: "No interruptions, good recording quality, participants took time with responses"
        
    optimal:
      level: 5
      label: "Purpose-built optimal"
      quality_signal: "VERY_HIGH"
      description: "Environment specifically designed for research quality"
      observable_signals:
        - "Professional research facility"
        - "All environmental variables controlled"
        - "Participants comment on comfort"
      scenario_manifestation: "Environment actively enhances data quality through thoughtful design"
      real_example:
        context: "Usability lab setup"
        observation: "One-way mirror, perfect recording, comfortable seating, participants fully engaged"
  
  scenario_generation:
    when_primary: "Describe sounds, interruptions, space, technical issues, participant comfort in detail"
    when_secondary: "Brief environmental mention - 'quiet room' or 'busy office'"
    avoid_combinations: ["'Optimal' environment with 'ad_hoc' collection is unlikely"]
    realistic_pairings:
      high_quality: ["controlled environment + professional rigor + comprehensive data"]
      low_quality: ["disruptive environment + rushed timing + incomplete data"]
      mixed_quality: ["optimal environment + convenience sample", "hostile environment + structured protocol"]
    
  contextual_weight:
    high_importance:
      - context: "Healthcare + Any + Sensitive topics"
        reason: "Privacy and comfort essential for health discussions"
      - context: "Any + Any + Think-aloud protocol"
        reason: "Need quiet environment to hear verbalization"
    low_importance:
      - context: "Retail + Any + Contextual inquiry"
        reason: "Natural environment noise is part of context"
  
  recognition_patterns:
    obvious_indicators: ["Can't hear responses", "System crashes", "Participants leave early"]
    subtle_indicators: ["Shortened responses", "Body language shows discomfort", "Researchers rush"]
    misleading_indicators: ["Fancy lab doesn't guarantee good environment if intimidating"]

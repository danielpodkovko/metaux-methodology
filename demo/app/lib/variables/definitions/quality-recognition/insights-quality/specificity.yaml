  display_name: "Insight Specificity"
  competency: "Insight Quality Recognition"
  family: "insight_quality"
  
  purpose: "Evaluates the precision and detail level of insights"
  
  concept_explanation: "Specificity separates meaningful insights from generic observations. Specific insights name exact problems, identify precise user groups, and pinpoint particular solutions. Generic insights could apply to any product; specific insights only fit this exact situation."

        - "Identifies user segments"
        - "Some quantification"
      scenario_manifestation: "Points to specific areas with moderate detail"
      real_example:

      level: 5
      label: "Laser-targeted precision"
      quality_signal: "VERY_HIGH"
      description: "Exhaustive specificity with complete context"
      observable_signals:
        - "Exact conditions and triggers"
        - "Specific user segments and contexts"
        - "Precise recommendations"
      scenario_manifestation: "Could only apply to this exact situation"
      real_example:
        context: "Error recovery study"
        observation: "Enterprise admins using SSO get stuck in login loop when session expires during bulk upload - occurs in Chrome 119+ with 2FA enabled"
  
  scenario_generation:
    when_primary: "Show the actual insights with their level of detail"

    realistic_pairings:

      - context: "Healthcare + Safety-critical features"
        reason: "Vague insights could miss critical safety issues"
      - context: "Fintech + Compliance requirements"
        reason: "Regulators need specific details"

evidence_support:
  display_name: "Evidence Support"
  competency: "Insight Quality Recognition"
  family: "insight_quality"
  
  purpose: "Assesses whether insights are backed by solid evidence or speculation"
  
  concept_explanation: "Evidence support determines whether insights rest on solid data or shaky assumptions. Strong insights trace directly to observed behaviors, quotes, and metrics. Weak insights involve leaps of logic, assumptions, and 'probably' statements. Evidence is the foundation of trustworthy insights."

  display_name: "Insight Novelty"
  competency: "Insight Quality Recognition"
  family: "insight_quality"
  
  purpose: "Evaluates whether insights reveal new understanding or confirm known issues"
  
  concept_explanation: "Novelty value determines if research money was well spent. Novel insights change thinking, reveal hidden problems, or unlock new opportunities. Obvious insights waste resources confirming what everyone knew. The best insights make stakeholders say 'we never realized that!'"

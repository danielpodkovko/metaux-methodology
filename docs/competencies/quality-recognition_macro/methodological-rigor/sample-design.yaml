  display_name: "Sample Design Quality"
  competency: "Methodological Rigor Recognition"
  family: "methodological_rigor"
  
  purpose: "Assesses whether the sample represents the population and supports valid conclusions"
  
  concept_explanation: "Sample design determines whose voices are heard and whether findings generalize. It's not just about size but about representation, diversity, and relevance. A small but well-designed sample beats a large but biased one."

      real_example:

  contextual_weight:

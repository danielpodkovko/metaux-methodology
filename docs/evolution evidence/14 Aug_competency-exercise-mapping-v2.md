# Competency to Cognitive Pattern Mapping v2.0
*Mapping micro-competencies to the Seven Pattern Framework*

## Mapping Philosophy

Each micro-competency can be trained through multiple cognitive patterns, with the optimal pattern depending on:
- **User Level**: Beginners need structure, experts benefit from synthesis
- **Learning Goal**: Recognition vs application vs integration
- **Assessment Focus**: Binary accuracy vs reasoning depth

The same competency trained through different patterns develops different aspects of expertise.

## Key Insights

### The Power of Pattern Evolution
The same micro-competency develops differently through different patterns:
- **SELECTION** builds recognition
- **RANKING** builds discrimination
- **ALLOCATION** builds optimization
- **ANALYSIS** builds understanding
- **SYNTHESIS** builds integration
- **DIALOGUE** builds reasoning
- **CALIBRATION** builds awareness

### Universal Pattern Applicability
Every competency can theoretically be trained through any pattern, but some combinations are more natural and effective. The key is matching pattern to learning goal.

### The Dialogue Destination
Most advanced training converges on DIALOGUE pattern because it:
- Integrates all other patterns naturally
- Mimics real-world application
- Enables deepest assessment
- Provides richest learning

So, during the demo I noticed one interesting thing. Some scenarios are quite interesting and I'd like to get deeper meaning I'd like to get more scenarios or tasks with a given scenario, right? I want to preserve it unless I'm satisfied with my depth of my next exercises. So, probably there should be a button when a scenario is presented and the answer is submitted. It's kind of like, I don't know how to do it from the UX perspective, but if this mark or button pressed, the next scenario will probably be a branch from the main narrative. Just a branch or probably a new tab that will go deeper in this specific scenario. Something like this.

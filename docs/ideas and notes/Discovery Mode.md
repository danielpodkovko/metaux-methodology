> Probably, if we let a system wander and improvise like in early prototype with made-up contextual patterns (probably, it could be a certain dev-only mode with lesser constraints), we could geat more interesting ideas that we can analyze systematically!

## Discovery Mode Concept ðŸ”¬

```typescript
// Two parallel modes:
const MODES = {
  TRAINING: "strict_framework",     // User-facing: Pedagogically controlled
  DISCOVERY: "exploratory_dev"      // Dev-only: Pattern discovery engine
}

// Discovery mode could:
// 1. Generate unconstrained patterns
// 2. Log them to a separate analytics DB
// 3. Show frequency and clustering
// 4. Suggest framework additions
```

### Benefits of Discovery Mode:

- **Pattern Mining**: Discover patterns you haven't thought of yet
- **Framework Validation**: See if AI consistently generates patterns outside your taxonomy (might indicate gaps)
- **Context Insights**: Learn how patterns manifest differently across industries
- **Evolution Data**: Data-driven framework expansion rather than theoretical

### Example Discovery Analytics:

```yaml
Discovered Pattern Frequency (last 100 scenarios):
- "researcher_fatigue": 23 times
- "participant_recruitment_bias": 18 times  
- "technical_disruption": 15 times

Cluster Analysis:
- "researcher_fatigue" often appears with "documentation_quality" (0.8 correlation)
- Suggests: Maybe fatigue is a sub-pattern of documentation?

**How to assess the answer's quality with multiple variables included:** 
since every variable will have 5 levels of quality from worst to best, and since every scenario will have multiple variables with different quality levels, how exactly the system would assess an answer in general? Would it be a weighted score for every recognized variable and its quality, or should it be something more sophisticated? It needs to be defined.

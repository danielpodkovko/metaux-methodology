# The Seven Pattern Framework: Evolved Training Mechanics

## Overview

A simplified, evolution-based approach to training mechanics where 7 core interaction patterns adapt to user level, replacing 17 distinct mechanics with transforming patterns that grow with the learner.

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Evolution Principle
Each pattern starts with structured UI for beginners and naturally evolves toward freetext as users advance. The cognitive skill remains constant; only the interface transforms.

```yaml
Same Pattern, Different Stages:
Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
UI Heavy → Semi-structured → Freetext
External scaffolding → Guided practice → Natural expression
```

### Why Seven Patterns?
These patterns represent fundamental cognitive operations in UX work:
- **Selecting** - Choosing what matters
- **Ranking** - Prioritizing by value
- **Allocating** - Distributing resources
- **Analyzing** - Breaking down complexity
- **Synthesizing** - Building up insights
- **Calibrating** - Knowing what you know
- **Dialoguing** - Reasoning through complexity

---

## Conclusion

The Seven Pattern Framework represents a fundamental simplification that preserves all cognitive training while reducing complexity. By thinking in terms of evolving patterns rather than fixed mechanics, we create a system that naturally grows with the user.

The ultimate insight: **We're not training 17 different interactions, we're training 7 fundamental cognitive operations that manifest differently as expertise develops.**

This is training design aikido - using the natural force of cognitive development rather than imposing artificial complexity.

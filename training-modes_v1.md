# MetaUX Training Modes Framework

## Overview
The MetaUX platform offers multiple training modes designed to develop pattern recognition competencies through different approaches. Each mode serves specific learning objectives and target audiences.

---

## Core Training Modes

### 1. ü•ã **Dojo Mode** (Isolated Competency Training)
**Purpose:** Deep practice of single competencies in pure isolation

#### Description
Train one specific micro-competency across hundreds of diverse scenarios without any skill context. Pure pattern recognition development.

#### Mechanics
- **Focus:** Single micro-competency (e.g., "Statistical Pattern Validity Recognition")
- **Scenarios:** Wide variety of contexts showing the same pattern
- **Progression:** All variable values for that competency (easy ‚Üí extreme)
- **Assessment:** Binary recognition accuracy + pattern sophistication

#### Example
```yaml
Training: "Signal vs Noise Detection - Statistical Validity"
Scenario 1: "Study shows 90% improvement (n=5)" - Healthcare context
Scenario 2: "87% of users prefer..." (self-selected survey) - E-commerce
Scenario 3: "Performance improved 5x" (no control group) - Enterprise
Pattern learned: Recognizing statistical validity issues regardless of domain
```

#### Best For
- Beginners building foundational pattern recognition
- Advanced practitioners filling specific competency gaps
- Anyone wanting deep mastery of particular patterns

#### Progression Path
1. Start with obvious patterns (tiny sample, huge claims)
2. Progress to subtle patterns (p-hacking, survivorship bias)
3. Master edge cases and complex interactions

### 2. ü¶Ñ **Unicorn Path** (Integrated Multi-Competency Training)
**Purpose:** Develop ability to recognize multiple patterns simultaneously in complex scenarios

#### Description
Train multiple competencies working together in realistic, complex scenarios. Develops ability to juggle different types of pattern recognition simultaneously.

#### Mechanics
- **Focus:** 3-5 competencies from different tiers working together
- **Scenarios:** Complex, multi-layered situations
- **Progression:** Number of simultaneous patterns increases
- **Assessment:** Recognition completeness + priority judgment

#### Example
```yaml
Training: "Stakeholder Research Planning"
Active Competencies:
- Context Recognition (startup vs enterprise)
- Constraints Recognition (budget, timeline)
- Human Pattern Recognition (stakeholder dynamics)
- Quality Recognition (method appropriateness)
- Power Dynamics (decision authority)

Scenario: "Startup CEO wants user research done in 2 days with $500, 
         CMO skeptical of research value, customers are enterprise buyers"
Challenge: Recognize ALL relevant patterns and their interactions
```

#### Best For
- Intermediate practitioners ready for complexity
- Professionals preparing for senior roles
- Those transitioning from execution to strategy

#### Progression Path
1. Start with 2-3 competencies in simple scenarios
2. Add more competencies and interactions
3. Introduce conflicting patterns and ambiguity
4. Master with boss-level modifiers (Complexity/Disruption)

---

### 3. üéØ **Skill-Focused Mode** (Skill-Enabling Competency Training)
**Purpose:** Train the specific combination of competencies that enable particular professional skills

#### Description
Practice the exact pattern recognition abilities needed for specific UX skills like "User Interview Conducting" or "A/B Test Design" - still training competencies, not procedures.

#### Mechanics
- **Focus:** 4-7 competencies that enable a specific skill
- **Scenarios:** Skill-relevant situations only
- **Progression:** From basic to expert skill application
- **Assessment:** Pattern recognition in skill context

#### Example
```yaml
Skill: "User Interview Conducting"
Required Competencies:
- Human Pattern Recognition [emotional_complexity: up to "mixed"]
- Context Recognition [interview_setting: all types]
- Quality Recognition [data_quality: recognize good vs poor responses]
- Signal vs Noise [participant_authenticity: genuine vs performed]

Scenario: Interview transcript with subtle deception cues
Challenge: Recognize authenticity, emotional state, data quality
```

#### Best For
- Practitioners focusing on specific skill development
- Role-specific training (researchers, designers, PMs)
- Targeted professional development

#### Progression Path
1. Individual competencies in skill context
2. Competency combinations for basic skill execution
3. Advanced patterns for skill mastery
4. Edge cases and difficult situations

---

### 4. üé® **Design Decision Challenges** (Synthesis Under Constraints)
**Purpose:** Practice synthesizing recognized patterns into design solutions

#### Description
Apply pattern recognition to generate and evaluate design solutions under various constraints. Not pattern training but pattern application and synthesis.

#### Mechanics
- **Focus:** Solution generation based on recognized patterns
- **Scenarios:** Rich context with multiple constraints
- **Task:** "What design decisions would you make?"
- **Assessment:** Solution feasibility + reasoning quality

#### Example
```yaml
Scenario: "B2B SaaS, enterprise healthcare client, HIPAA compliance required,
          2-week deadline, users complaining about onboarding complexity,
          engineering says simplification requires 6 weeks, CEO wants quick fix"

Expected Recognition:
- Regulatory constraints (HIPAA)
- Time vs quality trade-off
- Technical feasibility limits
- Stakeholder pressure patterns

Expected Synthesis:
- Propose phased approach
- Quick UX band-aids + longer-term fix
- Articulate trade-offs clearly
```

#### Best For
- Designers and design-oriented practitioners
- Senior practitioners making design decisions
- Product managers involved in solution definition
- Anyone bridging research insights to design implementation

#### Assessment Criteria
- Constraint recognition completeness (30%)
- Solution feasibility (25%)
- Trade-off articulation (25%)
- Reasoning clarity (20%)

#### Not Assessed
- Visual design quality
- Specific UI solutions
- Technical implementation details

## Specialized Training Modes

### 5. üèÜ **Boss-Level Challenges** (Extreme Difficulty Modifiers)
**Purpose:** Master performance under extreme conditions

#### Description
Apply any training mode with Complexity Navigation and/or Disruption Tolerance modifiers active.

#### Modifiers
- **+Complexity:** Multiple contradictions, ambiguous data, competing priorities
- **+Disruption:** Requirements change mid-scenario, stakeholders shift
- **+Chaos Master:** Both modifiers active simultaneously

#### Example
```yaml
Base Scenario: Standard user research planning
+Complexity: 5 stakeholders with conflicting goals, unclear budget, 
            contradictory user data
+Disruption: Mid-planning, company pivots strategy, PM leaves, 
            budget cut by 50%
```

#### Best For
- Advanced practitioners seeking mastery
- Principal/Director level preparation
- Crisis management training

---

### 6. üî¨ **Assessment Mode** (Competency Evaluation)
**Purpose:** Diagnose current competency levels and gaps

#### Description
Adaptive testing that identifies which micro-competencies need development and at what variable levels.

#### Mechanics
- **Focus:** Systematic competency evaluation
- **Scenarios:** Calibrated difficulty progression
- **Output:** Competency profile with specific gaps
- **Duration:** 30-45 minutes for comprehensive assessment

#### Results
```yaml
Your Competency Profile:
‚úÖ Signal vs Noise: Can handle up to "moderate" complexity
‚ö†Ô∏è Context Recognition: Struggles with "regulatory" contexts
‚ùå Power Dynamics: Needs development from basics
Recommended Training: Dojo mode for Power Dynamics basics
```

#### Best For
- Initial skill assessment
- Progress tracking
- Personalized learning path creation

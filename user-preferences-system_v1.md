# User Preference System for MetaUX Training

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Optional user configuration layer for personalized training experiences  
**Philosophy**: Intelligent defaults with optional user control

---

## **System Architecture Overview** üèóÔ∏è

### **Configuration Hierarchy**
```
1. User Preferences (optional - locked by user choice)
2. AI Assessment Results (automatic - based on performance analysis)
3. Learning Goal Requirements (dynamic - generated by AI)
4. Universal DNA Variables (adaptive - system managed)
5. Competency-Specific DNA (calibrated - difficulty tuning)
```

### **Core Principle**
**User preferences are simply variable locks applied to the existing Universal DNA system. No complex interpretation or special processing required.**

- **Default Mode**: All variables adaptive - AI manages everything based on performance
- **User Preference Mode**: Selected variables locked - AI manages remaining variables adaptively
- **Implementation**: User preferences directly map to existing variable lock mechanism

## **System Integration** ‚öôÔ∏è

### **Simple Configuration Processing**

#### **User Preference to Variable Lock Mapping**
```json
{
  "user_selections": {
    "product_domain": "financial_technology",
    "organization": "startup", 
    "pressure_level": "high_pressure",
    "team_context": "solo_work"
  },
  
  "resulting_variable_locks": {
    "product_category": "financial_technology",
    "organizational_stage": "startup",
    "time_constraint_pressure": "impossible", 
    "stakeholder_resistance_level": "hostile",
    "team_constraint_reality": "solo"
  },
  
  "remaining_variables": "30_other_variables_remain_adaptive"
}
```

#### **Scenario Generation Integration**
```
Training Session Flow:
1. User preferences ‚Üí Variable locks applied
2. AI assessment ‚Üí Learning goals generated  
3. Learning goals ‚Üí Competency selection
4. Locked + adaptive variables ‚Üí DNA configuration
5. DNA configuration ‚Üí Scenario generation

Result: Consistent context (locked) + varied challenges (adaptive)
```

#### **No Special Processing Required**
```
‚úÖ Use existing variable lock mechanism
‚úÖ Use existing scenario generation pipeline  
‚úÖ Use existing adaptive learning system
‚ùå No complex preference interpretation
‚ùå No special user preference logic
‚ùå No additional system complexity
```

### **Example Training Experience**

#### **User Locks: FinTech + Startup + High Pressure**
```
Scenario 1: "FinTech startup, hostile CEO, time pressure + budget constraints"
Scenario 2: "FinTech startup, hostile stakeholders, time pressure + technical debt" 
Scenario 3: "FinTech startup, hostile investors, time pressure + regulatory pressure"

Pattern: Consistent FinTech startup high-pressure context + varied other challenges
```

#### **User Locks: Healthcare + Enterprise (No Pressure Lock)**
```
Scenario 1: "Healthcare enterprise, supportive team, plenty of time + complex compliance"
Scenario 2: "Healthcare enterprise, skeptical stakeholders, tight deadline + technical constraints"
Scenario 3: "Healthcare enterprise, hostile regulators, crisis timeline + resource limits"

Pattern: Consistent healthcare enterprise context + system adapts pressure based on performance
